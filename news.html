                    <p>Manchester united wins first premier league game with <strong>2-1</strong> against rivals, liverpool after a devastating start to the season.</p>
                    <p>Jadon Sancho and Marcos Rashford led the reds to regaining their confidence after both players bagged a goal each for the team. Although the ferocious liverpool striker Mohamed salah gave the rivals a consolation goal in the 80th minute, it was not enough for the higly spirited manchester united team to give up their chance to first victory since the 2022/2023 season started.

                    <p><q>I said to <em>the players</em>, we have to act and not talk a lot. Make sure you are a team and
                            battle and be brave. it's not only about spirit when we are out of possession. Sometimes strikers think
                            they cannot do it because they have to save their energy for offensive actions.
                            Nowadays it's a demand to do both, then you can be a threat in possession and that is what you saw. It makes me happy that <em>Rashford</em> and
                            <em>Sancho</em> make the goals.</q> --Manchester United manager, ETH.</p>
