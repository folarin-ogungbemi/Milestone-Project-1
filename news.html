                <p>Manchester united wins first premier league game after a devastating start of the season.</p>
                <p>Goals from Jadon Sancho and Marcos Rashford helped Manchester United shrug off a tumultuous start to the season and beat Liverpool <strong>2-1</strong> at Old trafford to re-ignite their campaign. Mohamed Salah scored a consolation inside the final 10 minutes to give the hosts some nervous moments, but the victory is vindication for United boss <acronym title="Erik Ten Hag">ETH</acronym> as he tries to turn around a club in disarray</p>
                <p><q>It means a lot to all of us, you can see how the fans are reacting. We got the three points but on to the next one. 
                </div>
                <div class="part3 part">    
                We just have to produce like today in every single game. Happy we got the three points and we move on.</q>--Manchester United forward, Jadon Sancho</p>
                <p><q>I said to <em>the players</em>, we have to act not talk a lot. Make sure you are a team and battle and be brave. it's not only about spiritout of possession. Sometimes strikers think they cannot do it because they have to save their energy for offensive actions.
                </div>

                    <div class="part4 part">
                    Nowadays it's a demand and that is what you saw. It makes me happy <em>Rashford</em> and <em>Sancho</em> scored the goals.</q> --Manchester United manager, ETH</p>
                <p><q>Two points from nine is not the stat we wanted. We need to pick up our performances individually and collectively. We can't keep this going on out there: It is easy to talk about it in the changing room but we have to go out and do it. We can't keep conceeding goals. They started better than us today. It needs to change.</p>-- Liverpool defender Andy Robertson</q>
            </div>

            <div class="part5 part">
                <p><q><em>Missing numerous players</em> is obviously not cool but for the game tonight, i like the line-up. I saw good performances as well tonight, obviously not good enough to win the game. But i think we all know if we score in any situation the equaliser, it would not be the biggest surprise in the world. It is a deserved draw after a start where <em>United</em> looked sharper than us. But it was not for too long and in the situation, a little bit expected.</q> --Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp.</p>
