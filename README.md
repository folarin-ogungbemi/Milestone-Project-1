# Milestone Project 1

## Introduction

This website was created for the purpose of completing my first milestone project as a [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net "Link to code institute") student of a full-stack Software Developer course. This Project demonstrates the knowledge acquired afer the completion of the modules required to build the website. Technologies used for the Architectural design and structure are majorly based on HTML, CSS and UX Design modules. See below, in technology section of this documentation, a detailed list of technologies used for the completion of the project.

## Preview

![Website Mock-up](assets/images/GOSIP%20Mock-up.png "A pictographic display of the website on different devices")

GOSIP, coined from the word *gossip*, is a blog post intended to provide trending news from various sectors of the World. As at the time of creation, GOSIP reported news only pertaining to Sports, Music and Entertainment, and Education. However, the project is expected to extend beyond these topics and touch other interesting news around the world. During the creation of the website, user's target was taken into consideration. Hence, the website is responsive to ranges of screens of devices and pegged at a device with 320px screen size (i.e iphone 5).

            * Finally, the bash terminal for interacting with github is located right below this window.
        * To upload changes made in our repository to github in this IDE, the following commands are to be enetered after the $ sign in the bash terminal.
            * To check the status of your repository if any changes have been made.
                 ``` bash
