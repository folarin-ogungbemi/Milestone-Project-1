# Milestone Project 1

## Introduction

This website was created for the purpose of completing my first milestone project as a [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net "Link to code institute") student of a full-stack Software Developer course. This Project demonstrates the knowledge acquired afer the completion of the modules required to build the website. Technologies used for the Architectural design and structure are majorly based on HTML, CSS and UX Design modules. See below, in technology section of this documentation, a detailed list of technologies used for the completion of the project.

## Preview

![Website Mock-up](assets/images/Mock-up%20GOSIP.png "A pictographic display of the website on different devices")

GOSIP, coined from the word *gossip*, is a blog post intended to provide trending news from various sectors of the World. As at the time of creation, GOSIP reported news only pertaining to Sports, Music and Entertainment, and Education. However, the project is expected to extend beyond these topics and touch other interesting news around the world. During the creation of the website, user's target was taken into consideration. Hence, the website is responsive to ranges of screens of devices and pegged at a device with 320px screen size (i.e iphone 5).

# Deployment

## Project Creation

To start this project, It is recommended to use the [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template "Link to Code Institute template") already created by Code Institute. By using this template, necessary plugins for your project are downloaded for you. After clicking this link, the following steps are to be followed.
1. Navigate to "Use this template" on the page.
    * ![Use this template](assets/images/Use%20this%20template%20(Code%20Institute).png)
    * click on the button
1. Navigate to "repostory name"
    * Enter a name for your repository to continue (e.g Milestone project-1)
    * You may enter a description for the project. (Not mandatory)
    * keep your repository checked "public" for assessment purposes.
    * Then click on the button "Create repository from template".
    * ![Create repository for your project](assets/images/Repository%20creation.png)
1. Are your registered with gitpod by now?
    1. If No ? 
        * Visit the [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io "Click to visit gitpod") webiste and Login your details.
        * there after navigate back to Github and continue the steps after login.
    1. If yes ?
        * Navigate to the green button ["Clipboard"](https://folarin-ogungbemi.github.io/Portfolio-Project-1/ "click on this link to view clipboard") and click on it.
        * The creation of an environment might take a while. wait for gitpod to set up your environment.
1. Now we should have the [IDE](https://folarinogun-milestonepr-kf64x2mo04v.ws-eu63.gitpod.io/ "click to view interface") created.
    1. Here we have Visual Studio code as IDE.
        * By default, on the left side-bar is the respository we created in github (Milestone-project1) including an already made README.md file.
            * A mouse right click in this panel area gives us option to create new files and or folders in this repository.
            * On the right-side window next to the left side-bar, we can write our HTML, and CSS code.
            * Finally, the bash terminal for interacting with github is located right below this window.
        * To upload changes made in our repository to github in this IDE, the following commands are to be enetered after the $ sign in the bash terminal.
            * To check the status of your repository if any changes have been made.
                 ``` bash
                    git status
            *  To stage changes made 
                ``` bash
                    git add . 
            * To commit changes made 
                ```bash
                    git commit -m "commit message inbetween this quotes"
            * To push changes made to github
                ```bash
                    git push
            * View files that have been uploaded to github
                ```bash
                    git ls-files
                ```
