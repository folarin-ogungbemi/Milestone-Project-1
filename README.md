# Milestone Project 1

## Introduction

This website was created for the purpose of completing my first milestone project as a Code Institute student of a full-stack Software Developer course. This Project demonstrates the knowledge acquired afer the completion of the modules required to build the website. Technologies used for the Architectural design and structure are majorly based on HTML, CSS and UX Design modules. See below, in technology section of this documentation, a list of technologies used for the completion of the project.
