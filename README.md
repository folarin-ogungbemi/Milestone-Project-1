# Milestone Project 1

## Introduction

This website was created for the purpose of completing my first milestone project as a Code Institute student of a full-stack Software Developer course. This Project demonstrates the knowledge acquired afer the completion of the modules required to build the website. Technologies used for the Architectural design and structure are majorly based on HTML, CSS and UX Design modules. See below, in technology section of this documentation, a list of technologies used for the completion of the project.

## Preview

Gosip, coined from the word *gossip*, is a blog post intended to provide trending news from various sectors of the World. As at the time of creation, GOSIP reported news only pertaining to Sports, Music and Entertainment, and Education. However, the project is expected to extend beyond these topics and touch other interesting news around the world. During the creation of the website, user's guide was taken into consideration. Hence, the website is responsive to ranges of screens of devices and pegged at a device with 320px screen size (i.e iphone 5).
